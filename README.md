# RQuiz
Meant as an alternative to standard proprietary web-based study tools, RQuiz
is a CLI quiz platform to make and share flashcards to study, without paying a premium.   

For your convinence, every quiz will be formatted in JSON, to be easy to
make and share. (also easy to code)  

Definatly unfinished.


Things I need to do:
* seperate "multiple choice" and "typing" questions into functions 
so I can make them combine together in cool ways -- DONE!
* add cool command line ablilty to select a file to use instead of doing it from "tests/quiz1.json"
